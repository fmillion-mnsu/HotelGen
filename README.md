# HotelGen

This is HotelGen, a program to generate a full dataset simulating a hospitality/hotel chain.

This program is being developed in phases:

* **Phase 1:** Generation of:
    - [x] Individual hotels, including name, fake location, types and number of rooms, amenities
    - [x] Based on generic modeling data and a "mean + SD" randomizer approach
    - [x] Customer records
    - [ ] Guest stay records
    - [ ] Employee records per hotel (with basic payroll)
    - [ ] Basic financials
      - [x] Room rates
      - [x] Resort fees
* **Phase 2:** Expand with generation of:
    - [ ] Hotel reviews (AI generated)
    - [ ] Incidental charges (e.g. a retail-style marketplace)
    - [ ] Room service
    - [ ] Special resort charges - fitness room/spa/massage fees, concierge, tips...
* **Phase 3:** Expand with generation of:
    - [ ] Door lock system backend data (unlock events, failed events)
    - [ ] Damage fees (e.g. smoking in the room)
    - [ ] Specific anomalies - hotel underperformance, holiday surge, natural disaster
    - [ ] Directed trends - specify something that *should* appear in well-done analytics and have the data model it (AI assisted)
    - [ ] Website and SEO data (e.g. click tracking, website descriptions, potentially enough to generate full "websites" given AI generated hotel imagery and descriptive writing)
    - [ ] Expense events for more depth in accounting (supplies, lot rent, renovation...)
* **Phase 4:** TBD

The primary purpose of this software is to support my teaching of **CIS 444/544: Data Analytics** in my role as faculty at Minnesota State University, Mankato. However, this tooling may be useful to anyone interested in studying data analytics.
